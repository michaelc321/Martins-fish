                <section class="tips">Maintaining proper pH levels. pH is an indicator of the acidity or alkalinity of your tank water. Buy a pH test kit to check the pH level. Freshwater fish typically thrive when the pH level is between 6.8 and 7.5, depending on the species, as it is the range that will offer a natural environment that helps your fish resist illness. Check regularly for fluctuations and make the necessary changes to recalibrate as a change in pH greater than 0.3 in a 24-hour period can cause a fish to become stressed or susceptible to disease.</section>
